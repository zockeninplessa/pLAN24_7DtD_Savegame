Events always need a start and end date.

The start can be defined either by giving an exact date (start_date) or by specifying a base_date and optionally giving a start_offset. The start is inclusive.
Examples:
	- start_date="01/01"
		Start at new year
	- base_date="easter" start_offset="-2"
		Start at good friday (friday before easter sunday)

The end can be defined again either by giving an exact date (end_date), specifying a base_date and a required end_offset or by defining the length of the event in days (duration). The resulting end date must be at least one day after the start - the event will always last from 00:00 on start until 00:00 of end.
Examples (extending from start examples):
	- end_date="01/02"
		Last until the end of new year
	- base_date="easter" end_offset="2"
		Last until the end of easter monday
	- duration="4"
		Last 4 days, in the easter example this would be the same as the above example
